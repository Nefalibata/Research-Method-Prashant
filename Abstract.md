# **Abstract**
Seaweed is very essential to ecology as primary producers and because of their availability as a food source. The focus of this research is to assess the effects of light stress on seaweed, while studying, Ulva a green alga, under different light intensities. Triplicates of the algae were monitored in an aquarium system under two treatments: one within the optimal range of 32-820PAR and one below. The population cover of algae at our sampling site is 13.4%. Changes in pigments were observed, as Chlorophyll A increased and Chlorophyll B decreased in quantity, species identification showed Cladophora rather than Ulva.


# **Introduction**

Seaweed are photoautotrophic organisms that inhabit the ocean's upper layer, they are globally available and abundant (Gomez-Zavglia, 2019). They have a critical role in a functional and healthy marine ecosystem, not only because of their oxygen production abilities, but also because they are the basis of the marine food chain; providing organisms with nutrients, they contain numerous bioactive compounds, and energy (Chan, 2006).
